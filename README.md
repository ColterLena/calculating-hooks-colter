# Calculating Hooks Colter
Practice is key to gaining the mileage needed to conquer programming. A very common practice problem is to recreate a working calculator. A basic calculator is a good exercise in using state, effects, and components to create a powerful and robust UI.

## Objectives

- Practice using *functional components with hooks*
- Practice implementing a UI wire-frame

## Requirements

Create a simple calculator that allows the user to add, multiply, subtract, and divide two numbers. Here is a sample UI:

- [ ] Implement something similar to the example UI using HTML and CSS inside a React app
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to add two numbers
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to add subtract numbers
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to add multiple numbers
- [ ] As a user, I should be able to add divide numbers
- [ ] The clear button should reset the current calculation
